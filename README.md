# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to have an open record of the technical and engineering demos presented at Superb.

## Structure
Every demo will have a new directory in the root of the project. Every demo should have its own README in its relevant directory in addition to a small description and link in the main README.

Please be aware this is an OPEN SOURCE repository. Do not commit company IP or sensitive information. The purpose of this is to have open access to information, thus to design generalized demos.

## Demos
### [ArgoCD_karpenter](argoCD_karpenter/README.md)
